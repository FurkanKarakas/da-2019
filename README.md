# Distributed Algorithms 2019/2020 Practical Project

## Implementation of Broadcast Algorithms

This is the mandatory project in the Distributed Algorithms course at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). It counts for 40% of the total grade.

### Content of the Project

The goal of this practical project is to implement certain building blocks necessary for a decentralized system. To this end, some underlying abstractions will be used:

1. Perfect Links,
2. Uniform Reliable Broadcast,
3. FIFO Broadcast,
4. Localized Causal Broadcast.

Various applications (e.g., a payment system) can be built upon these lower-level abstractions.
